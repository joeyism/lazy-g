Whether you are *grunt*-ing, or *gulp*-ing, sometimes it is a hassel to type the whole word. **Lazy-g-cli** allows you to grunt/gulp with all the parameters, without having to type out the entire word of grunt/gulp. Because we are that lazy.

### To Install

    > npm install -g lazy-g-cli

### To Run

Whether you need grunt or gulp, just run

    > g

#### With Parameters

Running with parameteres is the same. That means running

    > g [param]

is the same as running

    > grunt/gulp [param]
